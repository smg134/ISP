Documentation:<br />
Login page will query a database containing account info. If a username and password match are found the user will be sent to the index homepage. When creating an account<br />
query checks if the username already exists, if not it inserts the new username and password pair into database. The create page will generate a text string of html code as the user<br />
adds things to their page. When they press the "Create page" button the title, html code, and username are stored in the database. When viewing a page, the html code of the selected page is<br />
loaded from the database and put onto the screen.<br /> There are two separate tables in the database, one for storing account name and password pairs, the other stores page titles, html text, and user<br />
names for each created page.
